🕹️ Hangman Game Project
Overview
This project is a simple text-based Hangman game developed using Python.
The player guesses a hidden word one letter at a time within a limited number of attempts.

Objectives
Build a basic word-guessing game using Python
Improve understanding of loops, conditions, and string manipulation
Create an interactive console-based program

Features
Uses a predefined list of 5 words
Limits incorrect guesses to 6
Displays progress after each guess
Console-based input and output

Technologies Used
Python
Random module
Basic console I/O

Workflow
Select a random word from a predefined list
Display blanks representing hidden letters
Take letter input from the user
Update guessed letters or reduce attempts
End the game when the word is guessed or attempts run out

How to Run
Open terminal or command prompt
Run the script
python hangman.py

Output
Displays the current state of the word

Shows remaining attempts
Win or lose message at the end

Internship Task
